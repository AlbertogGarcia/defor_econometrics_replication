	title = {Impacts of certification, uncertified concessions, and protected areas on forest loss in {Cameroon}, 2000 to 2013},
	abstract = {Deforestation and forest fragmentation are leading drivers of biodiversity loss. Protected areas have been the leading conservation policy response, yet their scale and scope remain inadequate to meet biodiversity conservation targets. Managed forest concessions increasingly have been recognized as a complement to protected areas in meeting conservation targets. Similarly, programs for voluntary third-party certiÔ¨Åcation of concession management aim to create incentives for logging companies to manage forests more sustainably. Rigorous evidence on the impacts from large-scale certiÔ¨Åcation programs is thereby critical, yet detailed Ô¨Åeld observations are limited, temporally and spatially. Remotely-sensed data, in contrast, can provide repeated observations over time and at a Ô¨Åne spatial scale, albeit with less detail. Using the Global Forest Change dataset, we examine annual forest loss in Cameroon during 2000‚Äì2013 to assess the impact of Forest Stewardship Council certiÔ¨Åcation, as well as uncertiÔ¨Åed logging concessions and national parks. We use panel regressions that control for the eÔ¨Äects of unobserved factors that vary across space or time. We Ô¨Ånd low forest loss inside the boundaries of each management intervention, with {\textless} 1\% lost over the study period. Yet those low levels of loss appear to be inÔ¨Çuenced more by a site's proximity to drivers of deforestation, such as distances to population centers or roads, than by national parks, uncertiÔ¨Åed concessions, or certiÔ¨Åcation. The exception is that if a site faces high deforestation pressure, uncertiÔ¨Åed logging concessions appear to reduce forest loss. This may reÔ¨Çect private companies' incentives to protect rights to forest use. Such an inÔ¨Çuence of private logging companies could provide a foundation for future impacts from certiÔ¨Åcation upon rates of forest loss, at least within areas that are facing elevated deforestation pressures.},

	title = {Two-stage diÔ¨Äerences in diÔ¨Äerences},
	abstract = {A recent literature has shown that when adoption of a treatment is staggered and average treatment eÔ¨Äects vary across groups and over time, diÔ¨Äerence-in-diÔ¨Äerences regression does not identify an easily interpretable measure of the typical eÔ¨Äect of the treatment. In this paper, I extend this literature in two ways. First, I provide some simple underlying intuition for why diÔ¨Äerence-in-diÔ¨Äerences regression does not identify a group√óperiod average treatment eÔ¨Äect. Second, I propose an alternative twostage estimation framework, motivated by this intuition. In this framework, group and period eÔ¨Äects are identiÔ¨Åed in a Ô¨Årst stage from the sample of untreated observations, and average treatment eÔ¨Äects are identiÔ¨Åed in a second stage by comparing treated and untreated outcomes, after removing these group and period eÔ¨Äects. The two-stage approach is robust to treatment-eÔ¨Äect heterogeneity under staggered adoption, and can be used to identify a host of diÔ¨Äerent average treatment eÔ¨Äect measures. It is also simple, intuitive, and easy to implement. I establish the theoretical properties of the two-stage approach and demonstrate its eÔ¨Äectiveness and applicability using Monte-Carlo evidence and an example from the literature.},

	abstract = {In this article, we consider identification, estimation, and inference procedures for treatment effect parameters using Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with (i) multiple time periods, (ii) variation in treatment timing, and (iii) when the ‚Äò‚Äòparallel trends assumption" holds potentially only after conditioning on observed covariates. We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001‚Äì2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The canonical difference-in-differences (DD) estimator contains two time periods, "pre" and "post", and two groups, "treatment" and "control". Most DD applications, however, exploit variation across groups of units that receive treatment at different times. This paper shows that the two-way fixed effects estimator equals a weighted average of all possible two-group/two-period DD estimators in the data. A causal interpretation of twoway fixed effects DD estimates requires both a parallel trends assumption and treatment effects that are constant over time. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and provide a new analysis of models that include time-varying controls.},

	abstract = {The human consequences of the recent global Ô¨Ånancial crisis for the developing world are presumed to be severe, but few studies have quantiÔ¨Åed them. This letter estimates the human cost of the 2008‚Äì2009 global Ô¨Ånancial crisis in one critical dimension‚Äîinfant mortality‚Äîfor countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis pools birth-level data, as reported in female adult retrospective birth histories from all Demographic and Health Surveys collected in sub-Saharan Africa. This results in a data set of 639,000 births to 264,000 women in 30 countries. We use regression models with Ô¨Çexible controls for temporal trends to assess an infant‚Äôs likelihood of death as a function of Ô¨Çuctuations in national income. We then calculate the expected number of excess deaths by combining these estimates with growth shortfalls as a result of the crisis. The results suggest 28,000‚Äì50,000 excess infant deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in the crisis-affected year of 2009. Notably, most of these additional deaths were concentrated among girls. Policies that protect the income of poor households and that maintain critical health services during times of economic contraction may reduce the expected increase in mortality. Interventions targeted at female infants and young girls can be particularly beneÔ¨Åcial. Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper, we assess whether the visibility of peers‚Äô adoption decisions leads to greater peer in uence. The context we study is residential rooftop solar panels. We exploit the plausibly exogenous location and orientation of peers‚Äô rooftop solar panels relative to proximate roadways and visual obstructions, such as vegetation, in order to determine whether geographically proximate peer installations increase a household‚Äôs probability of solar adoption more if they are visible from the road. We nd that the total angle of visibility of peer installations on the same street positively a ects solar adoption decisions at distances of at least 500 meters. In contrast, we only nd a positive e ect of non-visible solar arrays within 100m, which may be due to causal peer in uence via other channels such as word-of-mouth, or very localized unobservable e ects. The e ect of peer visibility is moderated by the economic value the peers receive from installing solar, providing suggestive evidence of social learning through visual information.},

We show a series of problems with conventional regressionbased two-way Ô¨Åxed eÔ¨Äects estimators, both static and dynamic. These problems arise when researchers conÔ¨Çate the identifying assumptions of parallel trends and no anticipatory eÔ¨Äects, implicit assumptions that restrict treatment eÔ¨Äect heterogeneity, and the speciÔ¨Åcation of the estimand as a weighted average of treatment eÔ¨Äects. We then derive the eÔ¨Écient estimator robust to treatment eÔ¨Äect heterogeneity for this setting, show that it has a particularly intuitive ‚Äúimputation‚Äù form when treatment-eÔ¨Äect heterogeneity is unrestricted, characterize its asymptotic behavior, provide tools for inference, and illustrate its attractive properties in simulations. We further discuss appropriate tests for parallel trends, and show how our estimation approach extends to many settings beyond standard event studies.},
