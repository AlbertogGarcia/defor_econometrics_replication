	abstract = {This paper studies eﬃcient estimation of causal eﬀects when treatment is (quasi-) randomly rolled out to units at diﬀerent points in time. We solve for the most eﬃcient estimator in a class of estimators that nests two-way ﬁxed eﬀects models and other popular generalized diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences methods. A feasible plug-in version of the eﬃcient estimator is asymptotically unbiased with eﬃciency (weakly) dominating that of existing approaches. We provide both t-based and permutation-test based methods for inference. We illustrate the performance of the plug-in eﬃcient estimator in simulations and in an application to Wood et al. (2020a)’s study of the staggered rollout of a procedural justice training program for police oﬃcers. We ﬁnd that conﬁdence intervals based on the plug-in eﬃcient estimator have good coverage and can be as much as ﬁve times shorter than conﬁdence intervals based on existing state-of-the-art methods. As an empirical contribution of independent interest, our application provides the most precise estimates to date on the eﬀectiveness of procedural justice training programs for police oﬃcers.},

We then discuss estimators that exploit knowledge of the remote sensing process to obtain consistent estimates. Finally, we assess our estimators via simulation and an impact evaluation of a conservation program in Mexico. We find that both geography and characteristics of the raw data can lead to systematic under-reporting of deforestation. However, accounting for these sources of error, which are common across many satellite-based metrics, can limit the bias from misclassification.},

	abstract = {Introduction The Welfare Act of 1996 banned welfare and food stamp eligibility for felony drug offenders and gave states the ability to modify their use of the law. Today, many states are revisiting their use of this ban, searching for ways to decrease the size of their prison populations; however, there are no empirical assessments of how this ban has affected prison populations and recidivism among drug offenders. Moreover, there are no causal investigations whatsoever to demonstrate whether welfare or food stamp beneﬁts impact recidivism at all.
Objective This paper provides the ﬁrst empirical examination of the causal relationship between recidivism and welfare and food stamp beneﬁts
Methods Using a survival-based estimation, we estimated the impact of beneﬁts on the recidivism of drug-offending populations using data from the National Corrections Reporting Program. We modeled this impact using a difference-in-difference estimator within a regression discontinuity framework.
Results Results of this analysis are conclusive; we ﬁnd no evidence that drug offending populations as a group were adversely or positively impacted by the ban overall. Results apply to both male and female populations and are robust to several sensitivity tests. Results also suggest the possibility that impacts signiﬁcantly vary over time-at-risk, despite a zero net effect.
Conclusion Overall, we show that the initial passage of the drug felony ban had no measurable large-scale impacts on recidivism among male or female drug offenders. We conclude that the state initiatives to remove or modify the ban, regardless of whether they},

	abstract = {Significance
            In our prospective study using nationally representative data from 13,611 adults in the US Health and Retirement Study, we used traditional and machine-learning statistical approaches to reveal the most important factors across the behavioral and social sciences that predict mortality in older adults. In the study, we found that top predictors of mortality spanned all investigated domains, opening up opportunities for future hypothesis generation in observational and clinical studies and the identification of potential new targets for screening and policy.
          , 
            
              Behavioral and social scientists have identified many nonbiological predictors of mortality. An important limitation of much of this research, however, is that risk factors are not studied in comparison with one another or from across different fields of research. It therefore remains unclear which factors should be prioritized for interventions and policy to reduce mortality risk. In the current investigation, we compare 57 factors within a multidisciplinary framework. These include (
              i
              ) adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial experiences during childhood and (
              ii
              ) socioeconomic conditions, (
              iii
              ) health behaviors, (
              iv
              ) social connections, (
              v
              ) psychological characteristics, and (
              vi
              ) adverse experiences during adulthood. The current prospective cohort investigation with 13,611 adults from 52 to 104 y of age (mean age 69.3 y) from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study used weighted traditional (i.e., multivariate Cox regressions) and machine-learning (i.e., lasso, random forest analysis) statistical approaches to identify the leading predictors of mortality over 6 y of follow-up time. We demonstrate that, in addition to the well-established behavioral risk factors of smoking, alcohol abuse, and lack of physical activity, economic (e.g., recent financial difficulties, unemployment history), social (e.g., childhood adversity, divorce history), and psychological (e.g., negative affectivity) factors were also among the strongest predictors of mortality among older American adults. The strength of these predictors should be used to guide future transdisciplinary investigations and intervention studies across the fields of epidemiology, psychology, sociology, economics, and medicine to understand how changes in these factors alter individual mortality risk.},

The collective of methods to analyze such data are called survival analysis, event history analysis or duration analysis. Survival analysis is widely applicable because the deﬁnition of an ’event’ can be manifold and examples include death, graduation, purchase or bankruptcy. Hence, application areas range from medicine and sociology to marketing and economics. In this paper, we review the theoretical basics of survival analysis including estimators for survival and hazard functions. We discuss the Cox Proportional Hazard Model in detail and also approaches for testing the proportional hazard (PH) assumption. Furthermore, we discuss stratiﬁed Cox models for cases when the PH assumption does not hold. Our discussion is complemented with a worked example using the statistical programming language R to enable the practical application of the methodology.},

To avoid bias, we compare these protected locations with unprotected locations that are similar in their characteristics relevant for deforestation. We ﬁnd that sustainable use protection, whose governance permits some local deforestation, is found on sites with high clearing threat. That allows more avoided deforestation than from integral protection, which bans clearing but seems feasible only further from deforestation threats. Based on our results, it seems that the political economy involved in siting such restrictions on production is likely to aﬀect the ability of protected areas to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation.},

	abstract = {The underlying channels through which peer inﬂuence operates in durable good adoption can affect the ability of marketers to leverage them. In this paper, we assess whether the visibility of peers’ adoption decisions leads to greater peer inﬂuence. The context we study is residential rooftop solar panels. We exploit the plausibly exogenous location and orientation of peers’ rooftop solar panels relative to proximate roadways and visual obstructions, such as vegetation, in order to determine whether geographically proximate peer installations increase a household’s probability of solar adoption more if they are visible from the road. We ﬁnd that the total angle of visibility of peer installations on the same street positively affects solar adoption decisions at distances of at least 500 meters (m). In contrast, we only ﬁnd a positive effect of nonvisible solar arrays within 100 m, which may be due to causal peer inﬂuence via other channels, such as word of mouth, or very localized unobservable effects. The effect of peer visibility is moderated by the economic value that the peers receive from installing solar, providing suggestive evidence of social learning through visual information.},

Eco-certifications put sustainability restrictions on the operations of those concessions. For spatially detailed data, including many pre-treatment years, we use new difference-indifferences estimators to estimate 2002–2018 impacts upon Peruvian Amazon forests from both logging concessions and their eco-certifications. We find that the concessions − which in theory could raise or reduce forest loss − did not raise loss, if anything reducing it slightly by warding off spikes in deforestation pressure. Eco-certifications could reduce or raise forest loss, yet we find no significant impacts.},

Counterfactualbased methods are increasingly used to evaluate forest conservation initiatives. This review synthesizes recent studies quantifying the impacts of such policies and programs. Extending past reviews focused on instrument choice, design, and implementation, our theory of change explicitly acknowledges context. Screening over 60,000 abstracts yielded 136 comparable normalized effect sizes (Cohen’s d). Comparing across instrument categories, evaluation methods, and contexts suggests not only a lack of “silver bullets” in the conservation toolbox, but that effectiveness is also moderate on average. Yet context is critical. Many interventions in our sample were implemented in “bullet-proof” contexts of low pressure on natural resources. This greatly limits their potential impacts and suggests the need to invest further not only in understanding but also in better aligning conservation with local and global development goals.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses two important limitations of the common practice of testing for preexisting differences in trends (“ pre-trends”) when using difference-in-differences and related methods. First, conventional pre-trends tests may have low power. Second, conditioning the analysis on the result of a pretest can distort estimation and inference, potentially exacerbating the bias of point estimates and under-coverage of confidence intervals. I analyze these issues both in theory and in simulations calibrated to a survey of recent papers in leading economics journals, which suggest that these limitations are important in practice. I conclude with practical recommendations for mitigating these issues. (JEL A14, C23, C51)},

We begin by articulating a simple set of “canonical” assumptions under which the econometrics of DiD are well-understood. We then argue that recent advances in DiD methods can be broadly classiﬁed as relaxing some components of the canonical DiD setup, with a focus on piq multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, piiq potential violations of parallel trends, or piiiq alternative frameworks for inference. Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work. We conclude by discussing some promising areas for future research.},

	abstract = {This article proposes doubly robust estimators for the average treatment eﬀect on the treated (ATT) in diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences (DID) research designs. In contrast to alternative DID estimators, the proposed estimators are consistent if either (but not necessarily both) a propensity score or outcome regression working models are correctly speciﬁed. We also derive the semiparametric eﬃciency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric eﬃciency bound when the working models are correctly speciﬁed. Furthermore, we quantify the potential eﬃciency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable ﬁnite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. Open-source software for implementing the proposed policy evaluation tools is available.},

	abstract = {Deforestation and forest fragmentation are leading drivers of biodiversity loss. Protected areas have been the leading conservation policy response, yet their scale and scope remain inadequate to meet biodiversity conservation targets. Managed forest concessions increasingly have been recognized as a complement to protected areas in meeting conservation targets. Similarly, programs for voluntary third-party certiﬁcation of concession management aim to create incentives for logging companies to manage forests more sustainably. Rigorous evidence on the impacts from large-scale certiﬁcation programs is thereby critical, yet detailed ﬁeld observations are limited, temporally and spatially. Remotely-sensed data, in contrast, can provide repeated observations over time and at a ﬁne spatial scale, albeit with less detail. Using the Global Forest Change dataset, we examine annual forest loss in Cameroon during 2000–2013 to assess the impact of Forest Stewardship Council certiﬁcation, as well as uncertiﬁed logging concessions and national parks. We use panel regressions that control for the eﬀects of unobserved factors that vary across space or time. We ﬁnd low forest loss inside the boundaries of each management intervention, with {\textless} 1\% lost over the study period. Yet those low levels of loss appear to be inﬂuenced more by a site's proximity to drivers of deforestation, such as distances to population centers or roads, than by national parks, uncertiﬁed concessions, or certiﬁcation. The exception is that if a site faces high deforestation pressure, uncertiﬁed logging concessions appear to reduce forest loss. This may reﬂect private companies' incentives to protect rights to forest use. Such an inﬂuence of private logging companies could provide a foundation for future impacts from certiﬁcation upon rates of forest loss, at least within areas that are facing elevated deforestation pressures.},

	title = {Two-stage diﬀerences in diﬀerences},
	abstract = {A recent literature has shown that when adoption of a treatment is staggered and average treatment eﬀects vary across groups and over time, diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences regression does not identify an easily interpretable measure of the typical eﬀect of the treatment. In this paper, I extend this literature in two ways. First, I provide some simple underlying intuition for why diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences regression does not identify a group×period average treatment eﬀect. Second, I propose an alternative twostage estimation framework, motivated by this intuition. In this framework, group and period eﬀects are identiﬁed in a ﬁrst stage from the sample of untreated observations, and average treatment eﬀects are identiﬁed in a second stage by comparing treated and untreated outcomes, after removing these group and period eﬀects. The two-stage approach is robust to treatment-eﬀect heterogeneity under staggered adoption, and can be used to identify a host of diﬀerent average treatment eﬀect measures. It is also simple, intuitive, and easy to implement. I establish the theoretical properties of the two-stage approach and demonstrate its eﬀectiveness and applicability using Monte-Carlo evidence and an example from the literature.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

A causal interpretation of twoway fixed effects DD estimates requires both a parallel trends assumption and treatment effects that are constant over time.

We exploit the plausibly exogenous location and orientation of peers’ rooftop solar panels relative to proximate roadways and visual obstructions, such as vegetation, in order to determine whether geographically proximate peer installations increase a household’s probability of solar adoption more if they are visible from the road. We nd that the total angle of visibility of peer installations on the same street positively a ects solar adoption decisions at distances of at least 500 meters. In contrast, we only nd a positive e ect of non-visible solar arrays within 100m, which may be due to causal peer in uence via other channels such as word-of-mouth, or very localized unobservable e ects. The e ect of peer visibility is moderated by the economic value the peers receive from installing solar, providing suggestive evidence of social learning through visual information.},

We show a series of problems with conventional regressionbased two-way ﬁxed eﬀects estimators, both static and dynamic. These problems arise when researchers conﬂate the identifying assumptions of parallel trends and no anticipatory eﬀects, implicit assumptions that restrict treatment eﬀect heterogeneity, and the speciﬁcation of the estimand as a weighted average of treatment eﬀects. We then derive the eﬃcient estimator robust to treatment eﬀect heterogeneity for this setting, show that it has a particularly intuitive “imputation” form when treatment-eﬀect heterogeneity is unrestricted, characterize its asymptotic behavior, provide tools for inference, and illustrate its attractive properties in simulations. We further discuss appropriate tests for parallel trends, and show how our estimation approach extends to many settings beyond standard event studies.},
